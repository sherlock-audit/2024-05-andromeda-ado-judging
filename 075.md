# Merging Bank messages turns them into fire-and-forget

## Summary
Bank messages are merged into Bank messages by denomination in the Crowdfund ADO. The resulting messages, however, are fire-and-forget and do not revert the transaction when they fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
`merge_sub_msgs()` gets every Bank message of the same denomination and merges them into one Bank message.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/common/mod.rs#L95-L125
```rust
pub fn merge_sub_msgs(msgs: Vec<SubMsg>) -> Vec<SubMsg> {
    // ... snip ...

    for (to_address, amount) in map.into_iter() {
        merged_msgs.push(SubMsg::new(CosmosMsg::Bank(BankMsg::Send {
            to_address,
            amount,
        })));
    }

    merged_msgs
}
```

`SubMsg::new()` is used for the resulting Bank messages which sets the reply to never.

```rust
pub fn new(msg: impl Into<CosmosMsg<T>>) -> Self {
    SubMsg {
        id: UNUSED_MSG_ID,
        msg: msg.into(),
        reply_on: ReplyOn::Never,
        gas_limit: None,
    }
}
```

`merge_sub_msgs()` is only used in the Crowdfund ADO when transferring tokens and funds.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/non-fungible-tokens/andromeda-crowdfund/src/contract.rs#L587-L725
```rust
Ok(resp
    .add_attribute("action", "transfer_tokens_and_send_funds")
    .add_messages(transfer_msgs)
    .add_submessages(merge_sub_msgs(rate_messages)))
```

`add_submessages()` is used for the merged rate messages but they are fire-and-forget nonetheless.

## Impact
Sending fees can fail silently allowing end sales in the Crowdfund ADO to succeed even when tax and/or royalty fees are unpaid. There are a few ways the rate messages can fail which include:
1. Invalid recipients
2. Fees with different denominations as the payments (a separate issue in `on_funds_transfer()`)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider wrapping the Bank messages in a `SubMsg` that always replies in `merge_sub_msgs()`. Rely on `add_messages()` to set them to fire-and-forget when necessary.
