# set_permission() using string splicing may cause key conflicts

## Summary
set_permission() uses string splicing, which may lead to key conflicts and security risks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `set_permission()` is used to set permissions with the following code.
```rust
    pub fn set_permission(
        store: &mut dyn Storage,
        action: impl Into<String>,
        actor: impl Into<String>,
        permission: Permission,
    ) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
        let action = action.into();
        let actor = actor.into();
@>      let key = action.clone() + &actor;
        permissions().save(
            store,
            &key,
            &PermissionInfo {
                action,
                actor,
                permission,
            },
        )?;
        Ok(())
    }
```

Using string splicing may lead to key conflicts
Example: "abc+efg" = "ab "+"cefg"

`action`: is arbitrary
`actor`: is an addr, this address is also not guaranteed for string length and content

Because of the correct permissions, security should be paramount, and any potential pitfalls need to be avoided.

## Impact

Possible maliciously constructed key conflicts that could lead to security risks.

Don't use string splicing as a key;  Recommended Use MultiIndex
