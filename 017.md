# Withdrawing in ADO contracts will always fail since tokens can not be whitelisted

## Summary
Withdrawing in ADO contracts will always fail since withdrawable tokens can not be set.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an ADO contract [executes a withdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/withdraw.rs#L32-L119), it checks that every withdrawal is for a withdrawable token. If a token is not withdrawable, then an error is raised.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/withdraw.rs#L69-L72
```rust
for withdrawal in withdrawals.iter() {
    let asset_info: AssetInfo = self
        .withdrawable_tokens
        .load(deps.storage, &withdrawal.token)?; // ===> this will raise an error when loading a withdrawable that does not exist
```

There are implementations for [adding](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/withdraw.rs#L10-L20) and [removing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/withdraw.rs#L22-L29) withdrawable tokens. However, they can not be called from the ADO contract because the execute handler does not implement any messages for executing those functionalities. 

## Impact
Since withdrawable tokens can not be added to and will remain empty for ADO contracts, withdrawals will always fail for ADO contracts.

## Recommendation
Implement execute messages for [add_withdrawable_token()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/withdraw.rs#L10-L20) and [remove_withdrawable_token()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/withdraw.rs#L22-L29) in ADO contracts.
