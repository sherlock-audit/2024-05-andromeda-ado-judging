# claim_batch() last_claimed_release_time is set too large when the balance is not enough

## Summary

`claim_batch()` last_claimed_release_time is incorrectly set when the balance is not enough, causing the user to wait for a long time again to get their funds back.


## Vulnerability Detail
`claim_batch()` is used to retrieve funds

```rust
fn claim_batch(
...
    let current_time = env.block.time.seconds();
    ensure!(
        batch.lockup_end <= current_time,
        ContractError::FundsAreLocked {}
    );
    let amount_per_claim = batch.release_amount.get_amount(batch.amount)?;

@>  let total_amount = AssetInfo::native(config.denom.to_owned())
        .query_balance(querier, env.contract.address.to_owned())?;

    let elapsed_time = current_time - batch.last_claimed_release_time;
    let num_available_claims = elapsed_time / batch.release_unit;

    let number_of_claims = cmp::min(
        number_of_claims.unwrap_or(num_available_claims),
        num_available_claims,
    );

    let amount_to_send = amount_per_claim * Uint128::from(number_of_claims);
@>  let amount_available = cmp::min(batch.amount - batch.amount_claimed, total_amount);

    let amount_to_send = cmp::min(amount_to_send, amount_available);

    // We dont want to update the last_claim_time when there are no funds to claim.
    if !amount_to_send.is_zero() {
        batch.amount_claimed += amount_to_send;
@>      batch.last_claimed_release_time += number_of_claims * batch.release_unit;
    }

    Ok(amount_to_send)
}

```

We will calculate the amount of funds that can be claimed based on the elapsed time `elapsed_time = current_time - batch.last_claimed_release_time`.

There is a limitation: if the current balance is not enough, only the current balance can be claimed.

But the problem is: `last_claimed_release_time` is still modified to the current time.

This leads to a problem: suppose 1 token can be claimed in 1 day.

1. after 1 year, the user executes `claim_batch()` , expecting to get 365 back.
2. But the current balance is only 10, so `10` is claimed.
3. `last_claimed_release_time` is changed to `now`.

So the user has to wait for another year to get the remaining amount back.

We should dynamically adjust the `last_claimed_release_time` based on the actual amount of money retrieved.

## Impact

If the current balance is insufficient, the user will have to wait for a long time for the funds to be retrieved

## Recommendation

Recalculate `number_of_claims` based on `amount_to_send`.


```diff
fn claim_batch(
...

    if !amount_to_send.is_zero() {
        batch.amount_claimed += amount_to_send;
+      let number_of_claims = .... recalculate by amount_to_send
        batch.last_claimed_release_time += number_of_claims * batch.release_unit;
    }

    Ok(amount_to_send)
}

```
