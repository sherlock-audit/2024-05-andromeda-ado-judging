# Withdrawal of undelegated stake in `andromeda-validator-staking` will be DoSed if the validator is slashed for an infraction that occurred before beginning unbonding

## Summary
Withdrawal of undelegated stake in `andromeda-validator-staking` will be DoSed if the validator is slashed for an infraction that occurred before beginning unbonding

## Vulnerability Detail
When unstaking, the undelegated amount and completion time of the unbonding period is tracked in `UNSTAKING_QUEUE`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/bbbf73e5d1e4092ab42ce1f827e33759308d3786/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-validator-staking/src/contract.rs#L327-L342
```rust
pub fn on_validator_unstake(deps: DepsMut, msg: Reply) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    ...
    for attr in attributes {
        if attr.key == "amount" {
            fund = Coin::from_str(&attr.value).unwrap();
        } else if attr.key == "completion_time" {
            let completion_time = DateTime::parse_from_rfc3339(&attr.value).unwrap();
            let seconds = completion_time.timestamp() as u64;
            let nanos = completion_time.timestamp_subsec_nanos() as u64;
            payout_at = Timestamp::from_seconds(seconds);
            payout_at = payout_at.plus_nanos(nanos);
        }
    }
    UNSTAKING_QUEUE.push_back(deps.storage, &UnstakingTokens { fund, payout_at })?;
```
When withdrawing the unstaked funds, we attempt to withdraw funds for matured unbonding delegations (based on `payout_at` recorded in the `UNSTAKING_QUEUE`) and the recorded undelegated amount **at the time we begin unbonding**.

```rust
    let mut funds = Vec::<Coin>::new();
    loop {
        match UNSTAKING_QUEUE.front(deps.storage).unwrap() {
            Some(UnstakingTokens { payout_at, .. }) if payout_at <= env.block.time => {
                if let Some(UnstakingTokens { fund, .. }) =
                    UNSTAKING_QUEUE.pop_front(deps.storage)?
                {
                    funds.push(fund)
                }
            }
            _ => break,
        }
    }
    ...
    let res = Response::new()
        .add_message(BankMsg::Send {
            to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
            amount: funds,
        })
```
The issue is during the unbonding period, the validator that was delegated to may have been slashed for an infraction that occurred before some unbonding delegations in `UNSTAKING_QUEUE` were started (since validators are slashed when they are 'caught', not when they made the infraction - see [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/build/modules/slashing#infraction-timelines), the mechanism is similar across the Cosmos SDK versions in use). In this event, such unbonding delegations will have their undelegated amount slashed. Consequently, on completion of unbonding, the actual amount received by the contract is less than that recorded in `UNSTAKING_QUEUE` and when the affected unbonding delegation(s) mature, `execute_withdraw_fund` will be DoSed due to insufficient funds.

Note that the funds and functionality could be rescued if the owner has enough funds, or utilises a flash loan, to send to the contract and cover the slashed amount so withdrawal can complete. However, it seems unreasonable to expect the owner to have these funds (which could be a very large amount depending on the undelegated amount and slashing percentage) or rely on external systems to recover funds, or to even have to recover funds in the first place.

(There is no way to directly withdraw funds since in the provided commit there is no way to modify `withdrawable_tokens`, so the withdraw feature is essentially disabled)

Paste the following test into `tests-integration/tests/validator_staking.rs`.
```rust
fn test_withdraw_after_slash() {
    let owner = Addr::unchecked("owner");
    let validator_1 = Addr::unchecked("validator_1");

    let mut router = mock_app();

    let andr = mock_andromeda(&mut router, owner.clone());

    andr.store_ado(&mut router, mock_andromeda_app(), "app");
    andr.store_ado(
        &mut router,
        mock_andromeda_validator_staking(),
        "validator-staking",
    );
    let validator_staking_init_msg = mock_validator_staking_instantiate_msg(
        validator_1.clone(),
        None,
        andr.kernel.addr().to_string(),
    );

    let validator_staking_component = AppComponent::new(
        "1".to_string(),
        "validator-staking".to_string(),
        to_json_binary(&validator_staking_init_msg).unwrap(),
    );

    let app_components = vec![validator_staking_component.clone()];
    let app = MockApp::instantiate(
        andr.get_code_id(&mut router, "app"),
        owner.clone(),
        &mut router,
        "Validator Staking App",
        app_components,
        andr.kernel.addr(),
        Some(owner.to_string()),
    );

    let validator_staking: MockValidatorStaking =
        app.query_ado_by_component_name(&router, validator_staking_component.name);

    // Set owner of the Validator Staking componenent as owner for testing purpose
    app.execute_claim_ownership(&mut router, owner.clone(), Some("1".to_string()))
        .unwrap();

    let funds = vec![coin(1000, "TOKEN")];

    // setup two unbonding delegations (two elements in staking queue)
    validator_staking
        .execute_stake(&mut router, owner.clone(), None, funds.clone())
        .unwrap();

    validator_staking
        .execute_unstake(&mut router, owner.clone(), None)
        .unwrap();

    // normally, the block height would progress and the unbonding delegations
    // that started after the infraction block height would be slashed
    // but we skip this detail for simplicity

    let slash_msg = cw_multi_test::SudoMsg::Staking(
        cw_multi_test::StakingSudo::Slash { 
            validator: validator_1.into_string(), 
            percentage: Decimal::percent(50) 
        }
    );
    router.sudo(slash_msg).unwrap();

    let unstaked_tokens = validator_staking.query_unstaked_tokens(&router).unwrap();
    let unbonding_period =
        unstaked_tokens[0].payout_at.seconds() - router.block_info().time.seconds(); 

    // Update block to payout period
    router.set_block(BlockInfo {
        height: router.block_info().height,
        time: router.block_info().time.plus_seconds(unbonding_period),
        chain_id: router.block_info().chain_id,
    });

    router.set_block(BlockInfo {
        height: router.block_info().height,
        time: router.block_info().time.plus_seconds(1),
        chain_id: router.block_info().chain_id,
    });

    // the contract receives the unstaked funds after the unbonding period
    let contract_bal = router.wrap().query_balance(validator_staking.addr(), "TOKEN")
        .unwrap();
    println!("Unstaked tokens received: {}", contract_bal.amount);
    assert_eq!(contract_bal, coin(500, "TOKEN"));

    // this should fail because in total our two unstaking queue elements require
    // 1000 tokens, but we only have 500 due to slashing
    let err = validator_staking
        .execute_withdraw_fund(&mut router, owner.clone())
        .unwrap_err();
    println!("{:?}", err);
}
```
The output (without the backtrace) should be
```bash
running 1 test
test test_withdraw_after_slash ... ok

successes:

---- test_withdraw_after_slash stdout ----
Unstaked tokens received: 500
Error executing WasmMsg:
  sender: owner
  Execute { contract_addr: "contract5", msg: {"withdraw_funds":{}}, funds: [] }

Caused by:

## Impact
Withdrawal of unstaked funds will be DoSed if the validator is slashed during the unbonding period.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When withdrawing, determine the set of denoms of unbonding delegations that have matured and withdraw the contract balance of each denom (since the only funds that should be in the contract are those received from matured unbonding delegations).
