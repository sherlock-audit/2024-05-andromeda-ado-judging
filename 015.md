# `andromeda-vesting` contract will be disabled if `WithdrawAddrEnabled` is ever set to false on the deployment chain

## Summary
`andromeda-vesting` contract will be disabled if `WithdrawAddrEnabled` is ever set to false on the deployment chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
In all functions in `andromeda-vesting` interacting with the Cosmos staking and distribution modules, a `SetWithdrawAddress` message is sent to execute before the main interaction. This message will always revert if the `WithdrawAddrEnabled` parameter is false for the chain the contract on.
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/8d205afbb387d52c5a9921e38c1a075b6de95392/x/distribution/keeper/keeper.go#L162-L169
Consequently, if `WithdrawAddrEnabled` is set to false, the contract owner will lose access to all functionality managing delegations.

## Impact
All functions interacting with the staking and distribution modules will revert if `WithdrawAddrEnabled` is set to false. This will continue as long as this parameter is not enabled.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the contract to receive rewards and allow withdrawal of excess funds (funds not set aside for vesting ie. delegation rewards) to the recipient.
