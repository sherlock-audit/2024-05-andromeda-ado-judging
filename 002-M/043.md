# If WithdrawAddrEnabled = false, execute_claim() will fail

## Summary
Currently, contracts that execute `execute_claim()` set `DistributionMsg::SetWithdrawAddress` first.
If `WithdrawAddrEnabled = false`, the execution will not succeed and the `claim` will not be executed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently the contract executes claims rewards by setting `DistributionMsg::SetWithdrawAddress` first.
```rust
fn execute_claim(
    ctx: ExecuteContext,
    validator: Option<Addr>,
    recipient: Option<AndrAddr>,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
...
    let res = Response::new()
@>      .add_message(DistributionMsg::SetWithdrawAddress {
            address: recipient.to_string(),
        })
        .add_message(DistributionMsg::WithdrawDelegatorReward {
            validator: validator.to_string(),
        })
        .add_attribute("action", "validator-claim-reward")
        .add_attribute("recipient", recipient)
        .add_attribute("validator", validator.to_string());

    Ok(res)
}
```

If the configuration `WithdrawAddrEnabled` is changed to `false`, setting `DistributionMsg::SetWithdrawAddress` will fail!
This will prevent the execution of the `claim`
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/distribution#msgsetwithdrawaddress
> # MsgSetWithdrawAddress
>By default, the withdraw address is the delegator address. To change its withdraw address, a delegator must send a MsgSetWithdrawAddress message. Changing the withdraw address is possible **only if the parameter WithdrawAddrEnabled is set to true.**
```rust
func (k Keeper) SetWithdrawAddr(ctx context.Context, delegatorAddr sdk.AccAddress, withdrawAddr sdk.AccAddress) error
 if k.blockedAddrs[withdrawAddr.String()] {
  fail with "`{withdrawAddr}` is not allowed to receive external funds"
 }

 if !k.GetWithdrawAddrEnabled(ctx) {
  fail with `ErrSetWithdrawAddrDisabled`
 }

 k.SetDelegatorWithdrawAddr(ctx, delegatorAddr, withdrawAddr)
```



## Impact
can't  claim reward

Manual Review

## Recommendation

when set `DistributionMsg::SetWithdrawAddress` , `SubMsg` using `ReplyOn.Error`, which is ignored when this message returns an error, to avoid the whole `execute_claim` from failing!
