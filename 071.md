# In `withdraw.rs::remove_withdrawable_token` error is not propagated

## Summary
There is no error handling to correctly propagate the error 
## Vulnerability Detail
Error handling is very essential in rust contracts and should be propagated correctly
On the other hand considering `remove_withdrawable_token` won't be a 100% successful everytime, it should be taken into account that [`remove_withdrawable_token`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/withdraw.rs#L22-L29) does not properly handle errors which can lead to so many complications later like silent revert and data inconsistency
## Impact
This can lead to silent failures and other complications
## Code Snippet
[`remove_withdrawable_token`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/withdraw.rs#L22-L29)
```solidity
    pub fn remove_withdrawable_token(
        &self,
        storage: &mut dyn Storage,
        name: &str,
    ) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
        self.withdrawable_tokens.remove(storage, name);
        Ok(())
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
a question mark should be added like this:
```diff
    pub fn remove_withdrawable_token(
        &self,
        storage: &mut dyn Storage,
        name: &str,
    ) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
-         self.withdrawable_tokens.remove(storage, name); 
+        self.withdrawable_tokens.remove(storage, name)?;
        Ok(())
    }
```
