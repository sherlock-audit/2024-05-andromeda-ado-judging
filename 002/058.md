# Lockup of vestings or completion time can be bypassed due to missing check for staked tokens

## Summary

The vesting module in the Andromeda protocol allows multiple vestings to be created. Currently restricted to the owner, it will be extended to any user. While tokens are vesting, they can be staked to earn rewards. However, the protocol does not account for the staked tokens when claiming vestings. This allows users to withdraw staked tokens, potentially circumventing the lockup period and withdrawing tokens from other vestings that are not yet matured. This issue results in the ability to bypass vesting schedules and access locked tokens prematurely.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vesting module allows for the creation of multiple vestings. This is restricted to the owner for now, but it will be extended to anyone. The current version can be used to proof lockup periods & vesting schedules to users. This is done by the owner depositing tokens into the contract and setting parameters for the vesting. While the tokens are vesting, they can be staked to a delegator to earn rewards by calling the [`execute_delegate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/bbbf73e5d1e4092ab42ce1f827e33759308d3786/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L306) function. The vestings are tracked using batch struct.

```rust
pub struct Batch {
    /// The amount of tokens in the batch
    pub amount: Uint128,
    /// The amount of tokens that have been claimed.
    pub amount_claimed: Uint128,
    /// When the lockup ends.
    pub lockup_end: u64,
    /// How often releases occur.
    pub release_unit: u64,
    /// Specifies how much is to be released after each `release_unit`. If
    /// it is a percentage, it would be the percentage of the original amount.
    pub release_amount: WithdrawalType,
    /// The time at which the last claim took place in seconds.
    pub last_claimed_release_time: u64,
}
```

The problem occurs because the batches do not account for how many of their tokens were staked. As a result, the recipient can still withdraw tokens from a vesting that is currently staked. This can be seen when looking at the function handling the claiming.

```rust
fn claim_batch(
    querier: &QuerierWrapper,
    env: &Env,
    batch: &mut Batch,
    config: &Config,
    number_of_claims: Option<u64>,
) -> Result<Uint128, ContractError> {
    let current_time = env.block.time.seconds();
    ensure!(
        batch.lockup_end <= current_time,
        ContractError::FundsAreLocked {}
    );
    let amount_per_claim = batch.release_amount.get_amount(batch.amount)?;

    let total_amount = AssetInfo::native(config.denom.to_owned())
        .query_balance(querier, env.contract.address.to_owned())?;

    let elapsed_time = current_time - batch.last_claimed_release_time;
    let num_available_claims = elapsed_time / batch.release_unit;

    let number_of_claims = cmp::min(
        number_of_claims.unwrap_or(num_available_claims),
        num_available_claims,
    );

    let amount_to_send = amount_per_claim * Uint128::from(number_of_claims);
    let amount_available = cmp::min(batch.amount - batch.amount_claimed, total_amount);

    let amount_to_send = cmp::min(amount_to_send, amount_available);

    // We dont want to update the last_claim_time when there are no funds to claim.
    if !amount_to_send.is_zero() {
        batch.amount_claimed += amount_to_send;
        batch.last_claimed_release_time += number_of_claims * batch.release_unit;
    }

    Ok(amount_to_send)
}
```

The vulnerability leads to further issues if multiple vestings exist. In that case, the user will actually be sent tokens from one of the other vestings, which are not currently staked. This is an issue as the other vesting from which the tokens will originate might still be in its lockup period, and the tokens should not be withdrawable.

### Exemplary scenario

1. `VestingA` (100 tokens) gets created with a `lockup_end` in 1 month and full claiming after that
2. User stakes all 100 tokens
3. `VestingB` (100 tokens) with `lockup_end` in 10 years is added
4.  One month passes, and `VestingA` matures
5. The user does not want to wait for the completion time when unstaking his tokens from `VestingA`, so he just calls to claim `VestingA` while they are still staked
6. As it is not checked which tokens are staked, the claim passes
7. The user has effectively bypassed the completion time/lockup period.

## Impact

This issue allows the recipient to circumvent the lockup duration of his vestings by withdrawing the tokens through another staked vesting.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend adding the parameter `staked_tokens` to the `batch` struct. 

```rust
pub struct Batch {
    /// The amount of tokens in the batch
    pub amount: Uint128,
    /// The amount of tokens that have been claimed.
    pub amount_claimed: Uint128,
    /// The amount of tokens that have been staked.
    pub amount_staked: Uint128, // <--- New variable
    /// When the lockup ends.
    pub lockup_end: u64,
    /// How often releases occur.
    pub release_unit: u64,
    /// Specifies how much is to be released after each `release_unit`. If
    /// it is a percentage, it would be the percentage of the original amount.
    pub release_amount: WithdrawalType,
    /// The time at which the last claim took place in seconds.
    pub last_claimed_release_time: u64,
}
```

This variable should be updated on each call to `executed_delegate()` and `execute_undelegate`. When a user tries to withdraw funds from his batch, the function must check if `amount - (amount_claimed + staked_tokens) >= tokens_to_withdraw`.  

```rust
fn claim_batch(
    querier: &QuerierWrapper,
    env: &Env,
    batch: &mut Batch,
    config: &Config,
    number_of_claims: Option<u64>,
) -> Result<Uint128, ContractError> {
    let current_time = env.block.time.seconds();
    ensure!(
        batch.lockup_end <= current_time,
        ContractError::FundsAreLocked {}
    );
    let amount_per_claim = batch.release_amount.get_amount(batch.amount)?;

    let total_amount = AssetInfo::native(config.denom.to_owned())
        .query_balance(querier, env.contract.address.to_owned())?;

    let elapsed_time = current_time - batch.last_claimed_release_time;
    let num_available_claims = elapsed_time / batch.release_unit;

    let number_of_claims = cmp::min(
        number_of_claims.unwrap_or(num_available_claims),
        num_available_claims,
    );

    let amount_to_send = amount_per_claim * Uint128::from(number_of_claims);
    let amount_available = cmp::min(batch.amount - (batch.amount_claimed + batch.amount_staked), total_amount); // <---- Changed LOC

    let amount_to_send = cmp::min(amount_to_send, amount_available);

    // We dont want to update the last_claim_time when there are no funds to claim.
    if !amount_to_send.is_zero() {
        batch.amount_claimed += amount_to_send;
        batch.last_claimed_release_time += number_of_claims * batch.release_unit;
    }

    Ok(amount_to_send)
}
```
