# Batch calculation is not correct

## Summary

`execute_create_batch` does not account for `validator_to_delegate_to`, so funds will not be sent to the current contract but directly to the `owner` or `recipient`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `execute_create_batch` function is designed to facilitate gradual fund disbursement, which is useful for participating in certain proposal votes.

However, when `execute_create_batch` is called with `validator_to_delegate_to` specified, the funds are ultimately sent to the owner instead of remaining in the current vesting contract. This creates a situation in the current vesting contract where the total amount of the current batch exceeds the amount that can actually be claimed. Furthermore, when `execute_claim` and `execute_claim_all` functions are eventually called, the intended amount that should have been sent to the recipient is reduced because it was sent to the owner instead. This scenario can lead to discrepancies in fund disbursement planning within the vesting contract.

Consider the following scenario:

1. Suppose the vesting contract has three batches: Batch 1, Batch 2, and Batch 3. Batch 1 has `validator_to_delegate_to` set, while Batch 2 and Batch 3 do not. Batch 1's creation time is Day 1, Batch 2's creation time is Day 10 with disbursement scheduled every 10 days, and Batch 3's creation time is Day 15 with disbursement scheduled every 5 days.

2. After 21 days, Batch 1's staking period ends, and the amount is transferred to the owner. However, the vesting contract still considers Batch 1's amount as being stored in the contract. When the owner attempts to call `execute_claim` to retrieve Batch 1's amount, the contract uses Batch 1's amount. If Batch 1's amount is significantly larger than that of Batch 2 and Batch 3, it prematurely claims the amounts from Batch 2 and Batch 3. This premature claiming disrupts the expected disbursement schedule of the batches and violates the invariant that funds should be gradually disbursed over specified time periods.

This process does not result in fund loss but severely disrupts the planned operation of the batches within the vesting contract.

poc:

1. The owner creates three batches with IDs 1, 2, and 3. Batch 1 is created with `validator_to_delegate_to` set to non-None. All three batches are created simultaneously. Batch 1 is set to be claimed in full after 21 days, while Batch 2 and Batch 3 are set to be claimed every 25 days for a total of 3 claims (3 * 25 days = 75 days). The total amount in Batch 2 and Batch 3 is less than that in Batch 1.

2. After 21 days, the validator sends the funds directly to the owner instead of leaving them in the vesting contract with the delegator.

3. On the 22nd day, the owner attempts to claim Batch 1. Since Batch 1's total amount is greater than that of Batch 2 and Batch 3, and Batch 1's funds were not transferred to the vesting contract, the claim for Batch 1 actually retrieves the funds intended for Batch 2 and Batch 3. Consequently, the owner claims the entire amount from Batch 2 and Batch 3 in one go.

4. At this point, the calculations for all batches become chaotic and do not proceed as expected.



## Impact

The vesting contract does not operate as intended; funds can be prematurely withdrawn, violating the invariant.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

After setting `validator_to_delegate_to`, batch-related variables should either be set to 0 or recipient should be set for `execute_delegate` in the future.
