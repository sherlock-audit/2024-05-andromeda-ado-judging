# Vested funds can be unavailable on claiming

## Summary
There is no guarantee that vested funds can be claimed by the vesting interval because the funds can be staked.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a batch is created in the Vesting ADO, funds for the vesting are deposited. These funds are claimable every set vesting interval.

The same funds deposited for vesting can be staked.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L306-L339
```rust
fn execute_delegate(
    // ... snip ...
    let asset = AssetInfo::native(config.denom.clone());
    let max_amount = asset.query_balance(&deps.querier, env.contract.address)?;
    let amount = cmp::min(max_amount, amount.unwrap_or(max_amount));

    ensure!(!amount.is_zero(), ContractError::InvalidZeroAmount {});

    let msg: CosmosMsg = CosmosMsg::Staking(StakingMsg::Delegate {
        validator: validator.clone(),
        amount: Coin {
            denom: config.denom,
            amount,
        },
    });
```

When the funds are undelegated, the undelegated amount is returned to the sender/owner and not back to the Vesting ADO.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L383-L420
```rust
let msg: CosmosMsg = CosmosMsg::Staking(StakingMsg::Undelegate {
    validator: validator.clone(),
    amount: Coin {
        denom: config.denom,
        amount,
    },
});

// when a message fails, the other messages are no longer executed
Ok(Response::new()
    .add_message(get_set_withdraw_address_msg(sender))
    .add_message(msg)
```

The same applies to [withdrawing staking rewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L422-L448) from the Vesting ADO. 

## Impact
The Vesting ADO does not guarantee that recipients will receive their vested funds, which is contrary to how vesting is supposed to work.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing staking or only allowing staking of a portion of the deposited funds for vesting. The recipients should be able to expect their vested funds to be available every vesting interval.
