# Valid VFS paths with "~" can fail validation

## Summary
VFS paths are validated across AndromedaOS with [`get_raw_address()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/amp/addresses.rs#L63-L71). Valid VFS paths may include "\~" to denote the home path. However, path resolution can fail for paths with "~" and in effect, cause validation with `get_raw_address()` to fail or return an incorrect address.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `get_raw_address()` is used to validate a VFS path, it queries the VFS to resolve it. It attempts resolving with [`resolve_pathname()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L57-L77) which eventually calls some internal functions where the issues lie. 

When passed valid VFS paths that look like `"~username/dir1/file"`, `get_raw_address()` would either fail or return an incorrect address. There are a few issues that lead to this behavior:

1. The first issue is in `resolve_home_path()` or `resolve_lib_path()`.

ref: [os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs::resolve_home_path()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L86-L91)
```rust
let username_or_address = if parts[0].starts_with('~') && parts.len() == 1 {
    parts[0].remove(0);
    parts[0].as_str()
} else {
    // @audit-issue when path is "~username/dir1/file", dir1 is used as the username instead of username.
    parts[1].as_str()
};
```
The path is split into 3 parts `[username, dir1, file]` and `"dir1"` is used as the username. The `else` clause gets run because there is more than 1 part. 

2. The second issue lies in `resolve_path()` when it loads the address from PATHS storage.

ref:  [os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs::resolve_path()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L128-L133)
```rust
// @audit-issue this user_address is already incorrect since it used `"dir1"` instead of `"username"` to load the address.
let mut address = user_address;
for (idx, part) in parts.iter().enumerate() {
    // @audit-issue This skips the first 2 parts which are supposed to be the root dir and username. However,
    // for the path "~username/dir1/file", the first 2 parts are `"username"` and `"dir1"`. 
    if idx <= 1 {
        continue;
    }

    // @audit-issue they key used for loading the path here is incorrect. The key used is `&(address, "file")`
    // instead of `&(address, "dir1")`. 
    let info = paths().load(storage, &(address, part.clone()))?;
    // ... snip ...
}
```
Apart from using the incorrect user address, the key for loading the path's address is wrong. 

## Impact
The issues above usually cause path resolution to fail or in the less likely case return an incorrect address. Since `get_raw_address()` is used all over AndromedaOS, this has far-reaching consequences and can cause loss of funds or core functionality breaking.

For example, the Validator Staking ADO does address validation of the recipient in [execute_claim()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-validator-staking/src/contract.rs#L208). The recipient that fails validation or gets an incorrect address can never claim their stake. In Kernel ADO, every local AMP message's [recipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-kernel/src/execute.rs#L377) is validated. This means the victim paths can not receive AMP messages since they will always fail validation or get an incorrect address.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider no longer supporting the "~username" pattern in paths or apply the following fixes to support the valid paths "~username/dir1/file":

1. Remove the "~"  even when there is more than 1 part in `resolve_home_path()` and `resolve_lib_path()`. 
```diff
-let username_or_address = if parts[0].starts_with('~') && parts.len() == 1 {
+let username_or_address = if parts[0].starts_with('~') {
    parts[0].remove(0);
    parts[0].as_str()
}
```

2. Possibly pass the index to `resolve_path()` from the caller so that `resolve_path()` knows which indexes to skip. For the common case, indexes 0 and 1 are skipped but for the case of `"~username/dir1/file"` paths, only index 0 should be skipped.
