# Result type not propagated and returned explicitly

## Summary
In [`query_batch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L578-L583) the result is not returned explicitly and doesn't propagate errors
## Vulnerability Detail
in `query_batch` the last line was[ `get_batch_response(&deps.querier, &env, &config, batch, batch_id)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L582)

Whenever the last line in rust is returned with no semi-colon & of the same datatype as the result it is implicitly returned, however this is not recommended because it is less explicit and may lead to misunderstandings or further complications in the return type

Again whenever this idiomatic style is used it does not handle errors as a result errors will not be propagated in the right way 

for referencing sake compare [`query_batch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L578) to [`query_batches`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L585-L600)

we will observe that the return value of `get_batch_response` is initialised into a variable `batch_response` and handled explicitly to propagate errors correctly. Next we see it returned explicitly by using  ok 

these two functions are similar but we can see one has a better implementation
## Impact
No error handling and erroneous return type
## Code Snippet
```solidity
fn query_batch(deps: Deps, env: Env, batch_id: u64) -> Result<BatchResponse, ContractError> {
    let batch = batches().load(deps.storage, batch_id)?;

    let config = CONFIG.load(deps.storage)?;
    get_batch_response(&deps.querier, &env, &config, batch, batch_id)
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Error should be handled explicitly and properly 
Result type should be returned properly and explicitly just as in `query_batches`
