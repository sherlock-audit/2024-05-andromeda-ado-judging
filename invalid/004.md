# A user with limit permissions may be unable to take an action even if permissions are disabled due to underflow

## Summary
A user with limit permissions may be unable to take an action even if permissions are disabled due to underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
When implementing a permissioned function, `is_permissioned` can be called to determine the caller's eligibility to call the function. If the caller has `Limited` permissions for the corresponding action, one use is always consumed.

```rust
        let permission = Self::get_permission(store, action_string.clone(), actor_string.clone())?;
        let permissioned_action = self
            .permissioned_actions
            .may_load(store, action_string.clone())?
            .unwrap_or(false);
        match permission {
            Some(mut permission) => {
                ensure!(
                    permission.is_permissioned(&env, permissioned_action),
                    ContractError::Unauthorized {}
                );

                // Consume a use for a limited permission
                if let Permission::Limited { .. } = permission {
                    permission.consume_use();
```
`permissioned_action` determines whether permissions are enabled for the action. If they are not, the caller should be allowed to make the action even if they have 0 uses remaining.

```rust
    pub fn is_permissioned(&self, env: &Env, strict: bool) -> bool {
        match self {
            ...
            Self::Limited { expiration, uses } => {
                ...
                if *uses == 0 {
                    return !strict;
                }
```
The issue is even though the caller is allowed, `is_permissioned` will panic due to underflow (since overflow checks are enabled in release) when one use is consumed if remaining uses are 0.

```rust
    pub fn consume_use(&mut self) {
        if let Self::Limited { uses, .. } = self {
            *uses -= 1
        }
```

## Impact
The user with 0 uses remaining on their limited permission is unable to make the action even though permissions are disabled for the action.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't consume a use if permissions are disabled for the action and uses are 0 (or possibly always even if uses aren't 0).
