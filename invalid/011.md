# Underflow Risk in Permission::consume_use Method

## Summary
The `consume_use` method within the `Permission` enum lacks a check to prevent underflow when decrementing the `uses` counter in the `Limited` variant. This could lead to unintended behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `consume_use` method, the code assumes that the `uses` counter is always greater than zero before decrementing it. However, if the `uses` counter has already reached zero and the method is called, it will result in underflow, potentially wrapping around to a large unsigned integer value.

## Impact
The underflow in the `uses` counter can lead to the Limited permission being interpreted as having an extremely large number of remaining uses, effectively granting unlimited access.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_base/permissioning.rs#L92

```rust
pub fn consume_use(&mut self) {
    if let Self::Limited { uses, .. } = self {
        *uses -= 1 // Potential underflow if *uses is already 0
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that the uses counter is greater than zero before decrementing it.

```rust
pub fn consume_use(&mut self) {
    if let Self::Limited { uses, .. } = self {
+       if *uses > 0 {
            *uses -= 1;
+       }
    }
}
```
