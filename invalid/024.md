# The contract cannot receive funds normally

## Summary

When a contract processes a message and doesn't match any handleable messages, it throws `Err(ContractError::NotImplemented { msg: None })`, causing the entire transaction to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the `validator_to_delegate_to` variable is set in the `execute_create_batch` function, the tokens will be staked by the delegator. After staking, the delegator will send the tokens back to the contract, where they will be claimed by the user. However, the contract cannot handle messages from other contracts. When an unexpected message is processed, an error will occur. Additionally, all message handlers in vesting require owner permissions to call. Therefore, vesting cannot correctly handle any messages other than those intended for ADO (for example, during Undelegate, Cosmos SDK sends a `MsgUndelegateResponse` which vesting does not handle).

Here's an explanation of why it cannot handle messages other than those intended for ADO: when a message is sent to the vesting contract, it invokes `handle_execute` to process the relevant message.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/bbbf73e5d1e4092ab42ce1f827e33759308d3786/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L85-L114

When a message is not found among the messages included in any vesting contract, it then calls ADO's `execute` and continues querying. However, if no message is still found in ADO's `execute`, it returns an error.

Therefore, encountering an unexpected message should result in an OK response rather than an error.

This issue persists in the latest official repo as well.

## Recommendation

Unknown messages should be handled with an OK response instead of an error (Err), indicating that no action is required.
