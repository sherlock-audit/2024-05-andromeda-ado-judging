# Arithmetic Overflow Vulnerability in `expiration_from_milliseconds` Function

## Summary
The `expiration_from_milliseconds` function in the provided code is vulnerable to arithmetic overflow when converting a time value in milliseconds to nanoseconds. This can lead to incorrect expiration time calculations, potentially impacting the logic and security of the smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function multiplies the input `time` (in milliseconds) by a constant `MILLISECONDS_TO_NANOSECONDS_RATIO` (1,000,000) to convert it to nanoseconds. However, if the `time` value is sufficiently large, this multiplication can exceed the maximum value that a `u64` (unsigned 64-bit integer) can hold, resulting in an overflow.

When overflow occurs, the result wraps around to a much smaller value, leading to an incorrect expiration time. This could cause the expiration to be set in the past, effectively making it immediately expired, or to a time much sooner than intended.

## Impact
The contract may incorrectly determine that actions or states have expired, leading to unexpected behavior and potential logic errors.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/common/expiration.rs#L14-L24

```rust
pub fn expiration_from_milliseconds(time: u64) -> Result<Expiration, ContractError> {
    // Make sure that multiplying by above ratio does not exceed u64 limit
    ensure!(
        time <= u64::MAX / MILLISECONDS_TO_NANOSECONDS_RATIO,
        ContractError::InvalidExpirationTime {}
    );

    Ok(Expiration::AtTime(Timestamp::from_nanos(
        time * MILLISECONDS_TO_NANOSECONDS_RATIO,
    )))
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the standard multiplication with a checked multiplication (checked_mul) operation

```rust
let nanos = time.checked_mul(MILLISECONDS_TO_NANOSECONDS_RATIO)
   .ok_or(ContractError::InvalidExpirationTime {})?;

Ok(Expiration::AtTime(Timestamp::from_nanos(nanos)))
```
