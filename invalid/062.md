# Only the last message in the AMP packet is handled in ADO Contracts

## Summary
ADO contracts can handle AMP messages but only execute the last message in the AMP packet. Other messages are disregarded.

## Vulnerability Detail
Every ADO contract calls `execute_amp_receive()` which handles receiving the AMP packet and executing its messages. In the function documentation for `execute_amp_receive()`, it states:
> Handles receiving and verifies an AMPPkt from the Kernel before executing the appropriate messages.
