# Valid VFS paths with usernames can always fail validation

## Summary
VFS paths are validated across AndromedaOS with [`get_raw_address()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/amp/addresses.rs#L63-L71). Valid VFS paths may include usernames. However, path resolution can fail for paths with valid usernames and in effect, cause validation with `get_raw_address()` to fail. This issue exists for a large subset of usernames and libraries.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `get_raw_address()` is used to validate a VFS path, it queries the VFS to resolve it. It attempts to resolve the path with [`resolve_pathname()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L57-L77) which eventually calls either [`resolve_home_path()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L92-L95) or [`resolve_lib_path()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L113-L116). The issue exists in both `resolve_lib_path()` and `resolve_home_path()`.

When the VFS path includes a registered username or library and that username/library is also a valid address according to `deps.api.addr_validate()`, the address stored for the registered username/library will not be loaded. 

ref: [andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs::resolve_home_path()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L92-L95)
```rust
// @audit-issue if a username is also a valid address, then the address for the registered username can never be loaded
let user_address = match api.addr_validate(username_or_address) {
    Ok(addr) => addr,
    Err(_e) => USERS.load(storage, username_or_address)?, 
};
resolve_path(storage, api, parts, user_address)
```

The username/library will be used for path resolution instead of the stored address which will cause an error because a non-existent path is being loaded.

ref: [andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs::resolve_path()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L121-L133)
```rust
fn resolve_path(
    storage: &dyn Storage,
    api: &dyn Api,
    parts: Vec<String>,
    user_address: Addr,
) -> Result<Addr, ContractError> {
    let mut address = user_address;
    for (idx, part) in parts.iter().enumerate() {
        if idx <= 1 {
            continue;
        }
        // @audit-issue address here will be the username or library instead of an address. the key is non-existent
        // and will cause an error
        let info = paths().load(storage, &(address, part.clone()))?;
```

The issue can be verified by changing the `username` in the test [`test_resolve_home_path`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L290) and then running the test with `cargo test -- test_resolve_home_path --show-output`. 

```diff
fn test_resolve_home_path() {
    let mut deps = mock_dependencies();
-   let username = "u1";
+   let username = "username1980";
```

## Impact
VFS path validation is done all over AndromedaOS. This issue will break a lot of functionality and cause a loss of funds for the valid paths that are victims of this bug. For example, the Validator Staking ADO does address validation of the recipient in [`execute_claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-validator-staking/src/contract.rs#L208). The recipient that fails validation can never claim their stake. In Kernel ADO, every local AMP message's [recipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-kernel/src/execute.rs#L377) is validated. This means the victim paths can not receive AMP messages since they will always fail validation. The consequences of this validation issue are far-reaching in the AndromedaOS system and are just a few of the impacts caused.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
When resolving the home or lib path, consider checking storage for the username or library. If it exists, then load the address for the username/library. If it does not exist, treat it is an address and validate it with `deps.api.addr_validate()`.
