# Logic Error in execute_start_sale: Unhandled None start_time Causes Contract Failure (Panicking on None start_time with Some duration

## Summary

Here is a summary of the bug i found in the contract:



- My Bug Type: Logic Error
- Location: execute_start_sale function
- Description: The function does not correctly handle the case where start_time is None and duration is not None, leading to a panic and potential contract failure.
- Impact: Contract failures, security vulnerabilities, or asset losses.



## Vulnerability Detail

Here is  my vulnerability details:


- Vulnerability Type: Logic Error

-  the Affected Function: execute_start_sale


- The  Vulnerability: The start_time.unwrap_or(current_time) line will panic if start_time is None, because unwrap is called on a None value.
- My Explanation: The code assumes that start_time will always be Some if duration is Some, but this is not guaranteed. If start_time is None and duration is not None, the code will panic.
- Impact: This vulnerability can cause the contract to fail and revert, resulting in an error message that may not be clear or helpful to the user.

To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that start_time is not None before trying to unwrap it, like this:

let end_expiration = if let Some(duration) = duration {
    if let Some(start_time) = start_time {
        expiration_from_milliseconds(start_time + duration)?
    } else {
        // Handle the case where start_time is None
        return Err(ContractError::InvalidState {});
    }
} else {
    Expiration::Never {}
};

This code checks if start_time is None before trying to unwrap it, and returns an error if it is.

## Impact


The impact of this my bug is:

- Contract failure and revert

- Potential asset losses or security vulnerabilities

- Unanticipated error messages

- Disruption of contract functionality

- Possible panic or abort of the contract execution

let start_expiration = if let Some(start_time) = start_time {
    expiration_from_milliseconds(start_time)?
} else {
    expiration_from_milliseconds(current_time)?
};

let end_expiration = if let Some(duration) = duration {
    expiration_from_milliseconds(start_time.unwrap_or(current_time) + duration)?
} else {
    Expiration::Never {}
};

## Tool used





Manual Review

## Recommendation



- Add a check to ensure that start_time is not None before trying to unwrap it, and handle the case where it is None appropriately.
