# Recipients are unable to claim their vested funds

## Summary
Recipients are unable to claim their vested funds since only the owner can call `claim` and `claim_all`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `claim` or `claim_all` are called, funds that have vested for the given batches are sent to the recipient. However, only the owner can claim vested funds instead of the recipient.

```rust
fn execute_claim(
    ctx: ExecuteContext,
    number_of_claims: Option<u64>,
    batch_id: u64,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let ExecuteContext {
        deps, info, env, ..
    } = ctx;
    let contract = ADOContract::default();
    // @audit-issue only owner can call this handler but recipient is the beneficiary of vested amount
    ensure!(
        contract.is_contract_owner(deps.storage, info.sender.as_str())?,
        ContractError::Unauthorized {}
    );

    // ... snip ...
    let withdraw_msg = config.recipient.generate_direct_msg(
        &deps.as_ref(),
        vec![Coin::new(amount_to_send.u128(), config.denom)],
    )?;
```

## Impact
The recipient of vested funds will be unable to claim their vested funds and will have to rely on the contract owner to claim it for them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing authorization for `claim` and `claim_all` to also allow the recipient to call it.
