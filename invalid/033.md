# Registering usernames can be used to hijack paths with app contracts

## Summary
An ADO contract can have an `app_contract` and resolving a local VFS path converts `"./"` in the path to `"/home/{app_contract}"`. However, anyone can register the `app_contract` as a username and hijack any VFS path that references `"/home/{app_contract}"`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

App contract is typically set by the App ADO with the `AssignAppToComponents` call and it sets the `app_contract` to the App ADO's contract address. Note that addresses are also valid usernames and vice-versa.

Anyone can register a username to point to their address if it has not been previously registered.

ref: [os/andromeda-vfs/src/execute.rs::register_user()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/execute.rs#L113-L147)
```rust
pub fn register_user(
    env: ExecuteEnv,
    username: String,
    address: Option<Addr>,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // ... snip ...
    let sender = address.unwrap_or(env.info.sender.clone());

    let current_user_address = USERS.may_load(env.deps.storage, username.as_str())?;
    if current_user_address.is_some() {
        ensure!(
            current_user_address.unwrap() == sender,
            ContractError::Unauthorized {}
        );
    }

    //Remove username registration from previous username
    USERS.remove(env.deps.storage, username.as_str());
    validate_username(username.clone())?;
```

There are no other restrictions on what usernames can be registered. An attacker can exploit this to hijack any VFS paths with app contracts by registering the app contract as their own username. When resolving and validating paths with `get_raw_address()`, it calls `local_path_to_vfs_path()` that converts "./" to "/home/{app_contract}". 

ref: [std/src/amp/addresses.rs::local_path_to_vfs_path()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/amp/addresses.rs#L97-L114)
```rust
match self.is_local_path() {
    true => {
        let app_contract = ADOContract::default().get_app_contract(storage)?;
        match app_contract {
            None => Err(ContractError::AppContractNotSpecified {}),
            Some(app_contract) => {
                let replaced =
                    AndrAddr(self.0.replace("./", &format!("/home/{app_contract}/")));
                vfs_resolve_symlink(replaced, vfs_contract, querier)
            }
        }
    }
```

`get_raw_address()` then calls `vfs_resolve_path()` that queries the VFS contract that eventually calls `resolve_home_path()`.

ref: [os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs::resolve_home_path()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/os/andromeda-vfs/src/state.rs#L92-L95)
```rust
    let user_address = match api.addr_validate(username_or_address) {
        Ok(addr) => addr,
        Err(_e) => USERS.load(storage, username_or_address)?,
    };
```

There is a bug here that has been reported in a separate issue. Once that bug is fixed and the expected behavior of loading the address of the registered username is working, it can be seen how "/home/{app_contract}" can point to the attacker's address. The attacker needs to register `app_contract` as their username. 

## Impact
All local path resolution and resolving paths with `"/home/{app_contract}"` or even `"/home/{username}"` can be hijacked by an attacker by registering `app_contract` or `username` as the attacker's username so it points to their address. The attacker's username registration needs to be done before the `app_contract` or other users register it. This is possible through front-running although it is unnecessary. 

Once the attacker hijacks valid VFS paths, they can cause a loss of funds or core functionality breaking for their target users or app contracts. For example, the Validator Staking ADO does path resolution and validation of the recipient in [execute_claim()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-validator-staking/src/contract.rs#L208). When the recipient is a VFS path with the hijacked `app_contract`, the attacker will end up claiming the stake. 

Since `get_raw_address()` is used all over AndromedaOS, this has far-reaching consequences and can cause loss of funds or core functionality breaking.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider loading app contracts separately from usernames when resolving paths and have them take precedence over usernames. For example, in `resolve_home_path()` it could look like:

```rust
let user_address = match APP_CONTRACTS.load(storage, username_or_address) {
    Ok(addr) => addr,
    Err(_e) => USERS.load(storage, username_or_address), 
};
let user_address = match user_address {
   Ok(addr) => addr,
   Err(_e) => api.addr_validate(username_or_address)?, 
}
```

The App ADO or some other permissioned contract should only be permitted to register app contracts in VFS. That way, paths with app contracts can not be hijacked by anyone.
