# Race Condition in Claim Batch Function (Vesting Contract)

## Summary
The `claim_batch` function in the vesting smart contract has a potential race condition vulnerability when multiple users request claims simultaneously. This vulnerability can lead to incorrect calculation of the claim amount due to asynchronous access and update of data.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `claim_batch` function, the contract balance is queried to calculate the amount available for claims. However, if there are multiple concurrent claim requests, the balance may change between the time of query and the time of updating the state of the vesting batch. This can lead to a user receiving more or less than the actual amount available.

## Impact
- Incorrect Calculation: Users may receive an incorrect amount of vesting tokens compared to the amount they are actually entitled to.
- Fund Imbalance: The contract may pay out too many vesting tokens, leading to insufficient funds to pay other users.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L464-L465

```rust
let total_amount = AssetInfo::native(config.denom.to_owned())
        .query_balance(querier, env.contract.address.to_owned())?;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use Locking Mechanism

```rust
...
+  let _lock = acquire_lock(deps.storage, batch_id)?;

    let total_amount = AssetInfo::native(config.denom.to_owned())
        .query_balance(querier, env.contract.address.to_owned())?;

    let elapsed_time = current_time - batch.last_claimed_release_time;
    let num_available_claims = elapsed_time / batch.release_unit;

    let number_of_claims = cmp::min(
        number_of_claims.unwrap_or(num_available_claims),
        num_available_claims,
    );

    let amount_to_send = amount_per_claim * Uint128::from(number_of_claims);
    let amount_available = cmp::min(batch.amount - batch.amount_claimed, total_amount);

    let amount_to_send = cmp::min(amount_to_send, amount_available);

    // We dont want to update the last_claim_time when there are no funds to claim.
    if !amount_to_send.is_zero() {
        batch.amount_claimed += amount_to_send;
        batch.last_claimed_release_time += number_of_claims * batch.release_unit;
    }

+  release_lock(deps.storage, batch_id)?; 

    Ok(amount_to_send)
```
