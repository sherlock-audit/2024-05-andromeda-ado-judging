# Missing Balance Check in Staking Process

## Summary
The `execute_stake` function in the smart contract does not check if the user has enough balance of the coin they want to stake before authorizing the transaction. This can lead to failed transactions or other unintended behaviors.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the` execute_stake` function, the code receives information about the amount of coins the user wants to stake but does not verify if the user actually owns that amount of coins. If the user does not have sufficient balance, the staking transaction will fail when it is submitted to the blockchain.

## Impact
Failed Transactions: Users may try to stake with insufficient balance, leading to transactions being rejected by the blockchain and wasting resources.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-validator-staking/src/contract.rs#L104-L136

```rust
fn execute_stake(ctx: ExecuteContext, validator: Option<Addr>) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let ExecuteContext { deps, info, .. } = ctx;

    // Ensure only one type of coin is received
    ensure!(
        info.funds.len() == 1,
        ContractError::ExceedsMaxAllowedCoins {}
    );

    let default_validator = DEFAULT_VALIDATOR.load(deps.storage)?;

    // Use default validator if validator is not specified by stake msg
    let validator = validator.unwrap_or(default_validator);

    // Check if the validator is valid before staking
    is_validator(&deps, &validator)?;

    // Delegate funds to the validator

    let funds = &info.funds[0];

    let res = Response::new()
        .add_message(StakingMsg::Delegate {
            validator: validator.to_string(),
            amount: funds.clone(),
        })
        .add_attribute("action", "validator-stake")
        .add_attribute("from", info.sender)
        .add_attribute("to", validator.to_string())
        .add_attribute("amount", funds.amount);

    Ok(res)
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a step to check the user balance before authorizing the staking transaction. Specifically:
- Query Balance: Use `deps.querier.query_balance` to get the user's balance of the coin they want to stake.
- Compare Balance: Compare the user balance with the amount of coins they want to stake.
- Error Handling: If the balance is insufficient, return an InsufficientFunds error with a clear message to the user.

```rust
.......
// Delegate funds to the validator
let funds = &info.funds[0];

// Check balance 
let sender_address = info.sender.clone();
let sender_balance = deps.querier.query_balance(sender_address, funds.denom.clone())?;
ensure!(
    sender_balance.amount >= funds.amount, 
    ContractError::InsufficientFunds { 
        balance: sender_balance.amount, 
        required: funds.amount 
    }
);
.......
```
