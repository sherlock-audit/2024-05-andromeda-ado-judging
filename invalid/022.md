# vfs path error

## Summary

Regardless of whether it's in the current Sherlock repo or the latest official repo, there are issues with the VFS path.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current Sherlock repo, there are issues with the VFS, which were mentioned in past reports and marked as fixed.

However, in the latest version of the repo, this issue still exists, with `./` being replaced by `~{app_contract}/`.

```solidity
    /// Converts a local path to a valid VFS path by replacing `./` with the app contract address
    pub fn local_path_to_vfs_path(
        &self,
        storage: &dyn Storage,
        querier: &QuerierWrapper,
        vfs_contract: impl Into<String>,
    ) -> Result<AndrAddr, ContractError> {
        match self.is_local_path() {
            true => {
                let app_contract = ADOContract::default().get_app_contract(storage)?;
                match app_contract {
                    None => Err(ContractError::AppContractNotSpecified {}),
                    Some(app_contract) => {
                        let replaced = AndrAddr(self.0.replace("./", &format!("~{app_contract}/")));
                        vfs_resolve_symlink(replaced, vfs_contract, querier)
                    }
                }
            }
            false => Ok(self.clone()),
        }
    }
```

However, according to the Andromeda documentation :https://docs.andromedaprotocol.io/andromeda/platform-and-framework/andromeda-messaging-protocol/virtual-file-system#:~:text=The%20following%20paths%20are%20now%20registered

 it should use `~/USERNAME/{app_contract}`.

## Impact

Incorrect VFS path parsing will cause functionalities related to VFS to run incorrectly.
