# `amount_available` can underflow in `claim_batch`

## Summary
[`amount_available`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L476) can underflow
## Vulnerability Detail
`amount_available` can undeflow in the sense that
```solidity
fn claim_batch(
    querier: &QuerierWrapper,
    env: &Env,
    batch: &mut Batch,
    config: &Config,
    number_of_claims: Option<u64>,
) -> Result<Uint128, ContractError> {
   ...

    let amount_to_send = amount_per_claim * Uint128::from(number_of_claims);
@-->    let amount_available = cmp::min(batch.amount - batch.amount_claimed, total_amount);


    let amount_to_send = cmp::min(amount_to_send, amount_available);

    ...

    Ok(amount_to_send)
}
```

looking at the function, lets assume that:
80% of the batch.amount has been claimed
and then we come to claim the rest of the 20%
the calculation in the amount_available `batch.amount - batch.amount_claimed` will be;
`20% * batch.amount - 80% * batch.amount` which is = underflow because
there is no check before this making sure batch.amount is always greater than or equal to amount_claimed
## Impact
Undeflow in `amount_available`
## Code Snippet
```solidity
fn claim_batch(
    querier: &QuerierWrapper,
    env: &Env,
    batch: &mut Batch,
    config: &Config,
    number_of_claims: Option<u64>,
) -> Result<Uint128, ContractError> {
    let current_time = env.block.time.seconds();
    ensure!(
        batch.lockup_end <= current_time,
        ContractError::FundsAreLocked {}
    );
    let amount_per_claim = batch.release_amount.get_amount(batch.amount)?;

    let total_amount = AssetInfo::native(config.denom.to_owned())
        .query_balance(querier, env.contract.address.to_owned())?;

    let elapsed_time = current_time - batch.last_claimed_release_time;
    let num_available_claims = elapsed_time / batch.release_unit;

    let number_of_claims = cmp::min(
        number_of_claims.unwrap_or(num_available_claims),
        num_available_claims,
    );

    let amount_to_send = amount_per_claim * Uint128::from(number_of_claims);
    let amount_available = cmp::min(batch.amount - batch.amount_claimed, total_amount);


    let amount_to_send = cmp::min(amount_to_send, amount_available);

    // We dont want to update the last_claim_time when there are no funds to claim.
    if !amount_to_send.is_zero() {
        batch.amount_claimed += amount_to_send;
        batch.last_claimed_release_time += number_of_claims * batch.release_unit;
    }

    Ok(amount_to_send)
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use `checked_sub` to prevent underflows and overflows
