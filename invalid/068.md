# Delegate, Redelegate, Undelegate and Withdraw rewards functionality might break in the vesting contract

## Summary
The delegate, redelegate, undelegate and withdraw functionality sends the SetWithdrawAddress message along with the operation. This message will revert if the chain governance changes the WithdrawAddrEnabled parameter to false or the chain has the parameter as false by default.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [MsgSetWithdrawAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-validator-staking/src/contract.rs#L231-L233) message changes the recipient of the validator rewards to the new recipient in the message arguments. According to the cosmos distribution module [docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/distribution/04_messages.html#msgsetwithdrawaddress), this message reverts if the parameter "WithdrawAddrEnabled" is false. Here is a [reference](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/distribution/keeper/keeper.go#L162-L169) to the code in the Go Distribution module:

```go
// SetWithdrawAddr sets a new address that will receive the rewards upon withdrawal
func (k Keeper) SetWithdrawAddr(ctx context.Context, delegatorAddr, withdrawAddr sdk.AccAddress) error {
        //..
	withdrawAddrEnabled, err := k.GetWithdrawAddrEnabled(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
        //REVERTS IF THE PARAMETER IS FALSE
	if !withdrawAddrEnabled {
		return types.ErrSetWithdrawAddrDisabled
	}
       //...
```

This parameter can be changed by the chain governance any time. Also Cosmwasm enabled chains might also have the parameter set as "false" by default. If this is the case, any function that sends the message in the contract will always revert.

The following functions send the SetWithdrawAddress message when finishing:
- [execute_delegate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L306-L339): delegates tokens to a validator
- [execute_redelegate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L341-L381): redelegates tokens to a validator
- [execute_undelegate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L383-L420): undelegates tokens.
- [execute_withdraw_rewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L422-L448): withdraws all delegationn rewards.

This means that Delegate, Redelegate, Undelegate and Withdraw (almost all functions in the contract) are affected and will always revert if the conditions above are met.

## Impact

Contract functionality breaks. If there are funds in the contract that were delegated to a validator, these will be stuck in the validator without being able to undelegate them

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This message should be sent **optionally** and the user should be able to configure the contract to send the message or not.
