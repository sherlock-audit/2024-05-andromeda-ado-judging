# Missing Valid Address Check in execute_update_owner

## Summary
The execute_update_owner function in the smart contract does not check if the new owner address (new_owner) is a valid address on the blockchain before updating. This can lead to the contract being transferred to a non-existent or invalid address.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the execute_update_owner function, the code only checks if the sender is the current owner of the contract, but does not verify if new_owner is a valid address on the blockchain. This could allow an attacker (or an accidental user) to enter a non-existent address, an address that is not a wallet address, or even an address that cannot receive tokens.

## Impact
Loss of contract control: If new_owner is not a valid address, the contract owner will not be able to transfer ownership to another address, resulting in a complete loss of control over the contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/ownership.rs#L7-L24

```rust
    pub fn execute_update_owner(
        &self,
        deps: DepsMut,
        info: MessageInfo,
        new_owner: String,
    ) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
        ensure!(
            self.is_contract_owner(deps.storage, info.sender.as_str())?,
            ContractError::Unauthorized {}
        );
        let new_owner_addr = deps.api.addr_validate(&new_owner)?;
        self.owner.save(deps.storage, &new_owner_addr)?;

        Ok(Response::new().add_attributes(vec![
            attr("action", "update_owner"),
            attr("value", new_owner),
        ]))
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure the new_owner address is a valid wallet address on the blockchain before updating.

```rust
    pub fn execute_update_owner(
        &self,
        deps: DepsMut,
        info: MessageInfo,
        new_owner: String,
    ) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
        ensure!(
            self.is_contract_owner(deps.storage, info.sender.as_str())?,
            ContractError::Unauthorized {}
        );
        let new_owner_addr = deps.api.addr_validate(&new_owner)?;
        ensure!(is_valid_address(deps, &new_owner_addr)?, ContractError::InvalidAddress {}); 
        self.owner.save(deps.storage, &new_owner_addr)?;

        Ok(Response::new().add_attributes(vec![
            attr("action", "update_owner"),
            attr("value", new_owner),
        ]))
    }
```
