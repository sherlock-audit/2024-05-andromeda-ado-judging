# Auction ADO allows non-payment of taxes

## Summary
The amount of taxes returned by `get_tax_amount()` is typically added to the amount the payor is expected to pay. This is done for Crowdfund, CW721, and Marketplace ADOs but not for the Auction ADO.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the auction winner claims their NFT in the ADO contract, `purchase_token()` computes the total amount they should pay. This total amount may fees such as royalties and taxes. Any taxes returned by `get_tax_amount()` should be added to the amount the auction winner pays for. However, this is not done in the Auction ADO.

ref: [contracts/non-fungible-tokens/andromeda-auction/src/contract.rs::purchase_token()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/non-fungible-tokens/andromeda-auction/src/contract.rs#L514-L542)
```rust
  // ... snip ...
  let tax_amount = get_tax_amount(&msgs, state.high_bidder_amount, remaining_amount.amount);

  // Calculate total tax
  // @audit-issue this total tax amount is not used anywhere
  total_tax_amount += tax_amount;

  let after_tax_payment = Coin {
      denom: state.coin_denom,
      amount: remaining_amount.amount,
  };
  Ok((after_tax_payment, msgs))
}
```

Compare this to the Marketplace ADO where the tax is added to the required payment.

```rust
    let tax_amount = get_tax_amount(&msgs, state.price, remaining_amount.amount);

    // Calculate total tax
    total_tax_amount += tax_amount;

    let required_payment = Coin {
        denom: state.coin_denom.clone(),
        amount: state.price + total_tax_amount,
    };
    ensure!(
        has_coins(&info.funds, &required_payment),
        ContractError::InsufficientFunds {}
    );
```

## Impact
Auction winners can skip paying all taxes for their NFT purchases.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider fixing this incorrect use of `get_tax_amount()` in the Auction ADO by adding the tax amount to the remaining amount and possibly validating that the claimer has sent enough funds to cover the purchase plus taxes.

```diff
    let after_tax_payment = Coin {
        denom: state.coin_denom,
-       amount: remaining_amount.amount,
+       amount: remaining_amount.amount + total_tax_amount,
    };
```
