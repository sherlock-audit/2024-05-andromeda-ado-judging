# Expired blacklisting leads to greater access

## Summary
A blacklisting can expire and it will block a user's access until it expires. However, once it expires, the blacklisted user will have access as if they were whitelisted.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`is_permissioned()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_base/permissioning.rs#L50-L80) function checks whether a user is allowed access. There are 3 types of access:
1. Whitelisted - has access
2. Limited - can access while user has remaining uses
3. Blacklisted - can not access

When these permissions expire, their access changes:
1. Whitelisted - will only have access if not a permissioned action
2. Limited - will only have access if not a permissioned action
3. Blacklisted - now has access

An expired blacklist should not increase the access of the formerly blacklisted user. They will have greater access than expired Whitelisted, Limited users, and other users that were never blacklisted.

```rust
Self::Blacklisted(expiration) => {
    if let Some(expiration) = expiration {
        if expiration.is_expired(&env.block) {
            return true;
        }
    }
```

## Impact
The CW721 ADO contract relies on [strict permission checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/non-fungible-tokens/andromeda-cw721/src/contract.rs#L246) for its minting functions. A blacklisted user can wait for their blacklisting to expire so they can mint NFTs arbitrarily.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the expired blacklisting logic or blacklisting. It seems only necessary to use blacklisting when all other users are allowed access.
