# Permissioned actions can not be disabled

## Summary
ADO contracts can set permissioned actions. However, once they are set, they can not be disabled.

## Vulnerability Detail
Every ADO contract has an execute handler that handles the `AndromedaMsg::PermissionAction` message. This sets the given action as permissioned. 

ref: [std/src/ado_contract/execute.rs::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/execute.rs#L92-L94)
```rust
AndromedaMsg::PermissionAction { action } => {
    self.execute_permission_action(ctx, action)
}
```

It updates the `permissioned_actions` with `permission_action()`. 

ref: [std/src/ado_contract/permissioning.rs::permission_action()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/permissioning.rs#L243-L251)
```rust
    pub fn permission_action(
        &self,
        action: impl Into<String>,
        store: &mut dyn Storage,
    ) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
        self.permissioned_actions
            .save(store, action.into(), &true)?;
        Ok(())
    }
```

The `PermissionAction` only ever sets an action as permissioned. To disable it, [`execute_disable_action_permission()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_contract/permissioning.rs#L272-L284) must be calledâ€”however, no ADO contract handler calls it.

## Impact
Once actions are permissioned in an ADO contract like the CW721 ADO, there is no way for the owner to open up the actions to all users. For example, the owner makes NFT Transfers in the CW721 ADO as a permissioned action. Once done, there is no way for NFT sellers and buyers to transact without the owner manually whitelisting them. The contract becomes unusable since buyers and sellers can not freely transact.
