# Missing Uniqueness Check for Module Address

## Summary
The `is_unique` function in the `Module` structure only checks the uniqueness of the module name (`name`) and not the uniqueness of the module address (`address`). This can lead to modules with the same address but different names being added to the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `is_unique` function, the check only focuses on counting the number of occurrences of the module name (`name`) in the `all_modules` list. However, two modules can have the same name but different addresses. This function does not check the uniqueness of the address, leading to modules with the same address but different names still being considered valid.

## Impact
An attacker can intentionally or unintentionally create modules with the same address but different names. This can cause confusion and conflicts in the system.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_base/modules.rs#L44

```rust
if self.name == m.name {
    total += 1;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check both the name and address of the module. This can be done by comparing both self.name and self.address with other modules in the all_modules list.

```rust
+ if self.name == m.name || self.address == m.address { 
       total += 1;
    }
```
