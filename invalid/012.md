# Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow Vulnerability in Withdrawal Calculation

## Summary
The `get_amount` functions in the `Withdrawal` and `WithdrawalType` structs lack checks for arithmetic overflow and underflow when performing calculations with `Uint128` values. This can lead to incorrect withdrawal amounts and potential financial losses. Additionally, the `claim_batch` function also lacks underflow checks.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Overflow in `WithdrawalType::Percentage`: When calculating `balance * *percent`, if the result exceeds the maximum value that a `Uint128` can hold, an overflow will occur, resulting in a smaller-than-expected withdrawal amount.
- Underflow in `claim_batch`: The calculation `batch.amount - batch.amount_claimed` can underflow if `batch.amount_claimed` is greater than `batch.amount`. This could lead to an incorrect calculation of `amount_available`, allowing users to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.

## Impact
Users could lose funds due to incorrect withdrawal calculations. In the case of overflow, the user may receive less than they are owed, while underflow could allow for unauthorized withdrawals.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/ado_base/withdraw.rs#L32-L35

```rust
WithdrawalType::Percentage(percent) => {
        ensure!(*percent <= Decimal::one(), ContractError::InvalidRate {});
        Ok(balance * *percent)
}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L476

```rust
let amount_available = cmp::min(batch.amount - batch.amount_claimed, total_amount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Checked Arithmetic: Utilize Rust's checked arithmetic operations (`checked_add`, `checked_mul`, etc.). These operations return an Option that is None if an overflow or underflow occurs.

```rust
Ok(balance.checked_mul(*percent).ok_or(ContractError::MathOverflow)?) 
```
