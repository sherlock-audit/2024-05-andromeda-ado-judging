# execute_create_batch will not work properly

## Summary

Since the recipient will not be the owner, `execute_create_batch` will not be usable.

## Vulnerability Detail

`execute_create_batch` can only be called by the owner, and when `validator_to_delegate_to` is set, `execute_create_batch` will call `execute_delegate`.

But the Sherlock docs mention: `For the vesting contract, the current recipient is the owner, but this is likely to be changed to a recipient address, and the delegation methods would be restricted to the recipient rather than the owner.` 

So the situation is: `execute_create_batch` can only be called by the owner, while `execute_delegate` can only be called by the recipient.

Therefore, when the `execute_create_batch` is set to be called only by the recipient in the future, `execute_create_batch` will not function properly.(note: recipient is a state variable, not a parameter) 

This issue exists in both the current Sherlock version and the latest official repo.

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Inline the current `execute_delegate` logic in `execute_create_batch` or allow both the owner and the recipient to call the `execute_delegate`
