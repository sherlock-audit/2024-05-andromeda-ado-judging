# Flat-rate fees can break `OnFundsTransfer` hooks

## Summary
The Rates module will compute fees and generate a message for transferring the fees when it is queried with the amount of funds to be transferred. However, calculating the flat-rate fee can return a `denom` different from the payment `denom`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `OnFundsTransfer` hook queries the Rates module which triggers `query_deducted_funds()`.

ref: [contracts/modules/andromeda-rates/src/contract.rs::handle_andromeda_hook()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/modules/andromeda-rates/src/contract.rs#L142-L149)
```rust
fn handle_andromeda_hook(deps: Deps, msg: AndromedaHook) -> Result<Binary, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        AndromedaHook::OnFundsTransfer { amount, .. } => {
            encode_binary(&query_deducted_funds(deps, amount)?)
        }
        _ => Ok(encode_binary(&None::<Response>)?),
    }
}
```

[`query_deducted_funds()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/modules/andromeda-rates/src/contract.rs#L159-L223) calculates every fee rate on the funds' transfer and generates messages for transferring the funds. When calculating the fee, however, it can set an incorrect `denom` when the fee is flat-rate.

ref: [packages/modules/src/rates.rs::calculate_fee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/andromeda-modules/src/rates.rs#L135-L157)
```rust
pub fn calculate_fee(fee_rate: Rate, payment: &Coin) -> Result<Coin, ContractError> {
    match fee_rate {
        Rate::Flat(rate) => Ok(Coin::new(rate.amount.u128(), rate.denom)),
        Rate::Percent(PercentRate { percent }) => {
            // ... snip ...
            // @audit-issue the `denom` for the returned `Coin` is the `payment.denom` while for flat rate fees
            // it's the `rate.denom`.
            Ok(Coin::new(fee_amount.u128(), payment.denom.clone()))
        }
    }
}
```

Since the `denom` for flat-rate fees is pre-configured, it can be a `denom` different from the funds being transferred. When the rate is non-additive, funds will be deducted but will break in the case of different denoms.

ref: [modules/andromeda-rates/src/contract.rs::query_deducted_funds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/modules/andromeda-rates/src/contract.rs#L170-L187)
```rust
let mut leftover_funds = vec![coin.clone()];
// ... snip ...
let fee = calculate_fee(rate, &coin)?;
for receiver in rate_info.recipients.iter() {
    if !rate_info.is_additive {
        // @audit-issue when it's a flat-rate fee, the fee's denom will be the rate's denom which can be different
        // from the denom of the leftover funds (payment)
        deduct_funds(&mut leftover_funds, &fee)?;
        event = event.add_attribute("deducted", fee.to_string());
    }
```

ref: [std/src/common/mod.rs::deduct_funds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/common/mod.rs#L158-L172)
```rust
pub fn deduct_funds(coins: &mut [Coin], funds: &Coin) -> Result<bool, ContractError> {
    let coin_amount = coins.iter_mut().find(|c| c.denom.eq(&funds.denom));

    // @audit-issue `coin_amount` will be None when funds.denom do not match the denom of leftover funds.
    match coin_amount {
        Some(c) => {
            ensure!(
                c.amount >= funds.amount,
                ContractError::InsufficientFunds {}
            );
            c.amount -= funds.amount;
            Ok(true)
        }
        None => Err(ContractError::InsufficientFunds {}),
    }
}
```

When the rate is additive, `deduct_funds()` will not be called; instead, messages for transferring funds will be generated.

ref: [modules/andromeda-rates/src/contract.rs::query_deducted_funds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/modules/andromeda-rates/src/contract.rs#L196-L206)
```rust
// @audit-issue when the payment coin is native, the fee is assumed to be native when the payment transfer message
// is generated. There is no guarantee the fee is also native because it can have a different denom.
let msg = if is_native {
    receiver.generate_direct_msg(&deps, vec![fee.clone()])?
} else {
    receiver.generate_msg_cw20(
        &deps,
        Cw20Coin {
            amount: fee.amount,
            address: fee.denom.to_string(),
        },
    )?
};
```

The generated messages will use the fee's amount and denom. When the flat-rate fee has a different denom from the payment denom, the messages may fail because the ADO contract may not have funds in that denomination. The fee is also expected to be native when the payment coin is native, which can be wrong because the fee can have a different denom.

## Impact
ADO Contracts for fungible and non-fungible tokens use the `on_funds_transfer()` hook for funds transfers. The issue of different denoms returned by `calculate_fee()` can break `execute_transfer()` and `execute_send()` in the CW20 ADO, for example. Some functions in several ADO contracts will be DOS'd until the offending rates are removed. 

The following combinations of rates and fund transfers will break execution:
1. Fund transfer of a native coin and a flat-rate fee of a cw20 coin
2. Fund transfer of a cw20 and a flat-rate fee of a native coin

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider generating a direct message when the fee is a native coin and generating a CW20 message when the fee is a CW20 coin instead of using the payment's denom as the basis.
