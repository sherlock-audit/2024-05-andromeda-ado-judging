# Creating a batch with invalid release amount locks funds permanently in Vesting ADO

## Summary
Vesting ADO allows the owner to create a batch for vesting. The `release_amount` is the amount released on every vesting interval. When the release amount uses an invalid rate, funds are permanently locked.

## Vulnerability Detail
The only validation on the release amount is that it is non-zero.

ref: [finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs::execute_create_batch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/contracts/finance/andromeda-vesting/src/contract.rs#L157-L160)
```rust
ensure!(
    release_unit > 0 && !release_amount.is_zero(),
    ContractError::InvalidZeroAmount {}
);
```

When the batch's vested funds are claimed, `get_amount()` is called on the release amount.

ref: [std/src/common/withdraw.rs::WithdrawalType::get_amount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-andromeda-ado/blob/main/andromeda-core/packages/std/src/common/withdraw.rs#L20-L25)
```rust
pub fn get_amount(&self, balance: Uint128) -> Result<Uint128, ContractError> {
    match self {
        WithdrawalType::Percentage(percent) => {
            ensure!(*percent <= Decimal::one(), ContractError::InvalidRate {});
            Ok(balance * *percent)
        }
        WithdrawalType::Amount(amount) => Ok(cmp::min(*amount, balance)),
    }
}
```

A release amount with a percentage more than 100% will raise an `InvalidRate` error. Since a batch is immutable, the funds are permanently locked in the Vesting ADO.

## Impact
Batch funds are permanently locked. Due to a separate issue related to withdrawable tokens, funds can not be withdrawn from the ADO contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding validation in `execute_create_batch()` that the release amount's percentage is not more than 100% or some other reasonably smaller percentage.
